Zoom meetings are by default protected by a six-digit numeric password, but according to Tom Anthony, VP Product at SearchPilot who identified the issue , the lack of rate limiting enabled ""an attacker to attempt all 1 million passwords in a matter of minutes and gain access to other people's private (password protected) Zoom meetings.""   It's worth noting that Zoom began requiring a passcode  for all meetings back in April  as a preventive measure to combat Zoom-bombing attacks, which refers to the act of disrupting and hijacking Zoom meetings uninvited to share obscene and racist content.

Mitron is not really a 'Made in India' product, and the viral app contains a highly critical, unpatched vulnerability that could allow anyone to hack into any user account without requiring interaction from the targeted users or their passwords.   I am sure many of you already know what TikTok is, and those still unaware, it's a highly popular video social platform where people upload short videos of themselves doing things like lip-syncing and dancing.   The wrath faced by Chinese-owned TikTok from all directions—mostly due to data security and ethnopolitical reasons—gave birth to new alternatives in the market, one of which is the Mitron app for Android.   Mitron  video social platform recently caught headlines when the Android app crazily gained over 5 million installations and 250,000 5-star ratings in just 48 days after being released on the Google Play Store.   Popped out of nowhere, Mitron i",https://thehackernews.com/search?updated-max=2020-05-26T07:40:00-07:00&max-results=8&start=72&by-date=false
A New Free Monitoring Tool to Measure Your Dark Web Exposure,https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/dark-web-monitoring-tool.html,"May 28, 2020",The Hacker News,"Last week, application security company ImmuniWeb released a new free tool  to monitor and measure an organization's exposure on the Dark Web.   To improve the decision-making process for cybersecurity professionals, the free tool crawls Dark Web marketplaces, hacking forums, and Surface Web resources such as Pastebin or GitHub to provide you with a classified schema of your data being offered for sale or leaked.   All you need to launch a Dark Web search is to enter your domain name.    The volume of stolen credentials on the Dark Web is booming   This week, over 26 million user records, including plaintext passwords, stolen from LiveJournal appeared on a Dark Web marketplace for as low as $35. The present week is likewise sadly marked with a compromise of 31 SQL databases (with 1.6 million rows of client data) from webshop owners.   There were 7,098 breaches reported in 2019, exposing over 15.1 billion records, a new worst year on record according to Risk Based Security report",https://thehackernews.com/search?updated-max=2020-05-26T07:40:00-07:00&max-results=8&start=72&by-date=false
Researchers Uncover Brazilian Hacktivist's Identity Who Defaced Over 4800 Sites,https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/brazilian-hacker-vandathegod.html,"May 28, 2020",Ravie Lakshmanan,"It's one thing for hackers to target websites and proudly announce it on social media platforms for all to see. It's, however, an entirely different thing to leave a digital trail that leads cybersecurity researchers right to their doorsteps.   That's exactly what happened in the case of a hacktivist under the name of VandaTheGod, who has been attributed to a series of attacks on government  websites since July 2019.   In a report shared with The Hacker News, researchers from Check Point said they were able to map VandaTheGod's activity over the years, and eventually zero down the attacker's real identity to a Brazilian individual from the city of Uberlândia.   The cybersecurity firm said it notified concerned law enforcement of its findings for further action, adding the social media activities on profiles associated with VandaTheGod came to a halt towards the end of 2019.    A Long Social Media Trail   VandaTheGod has a long history of going after government we",https://thehackernews.com/search?updated-max=2020-05-26T07:40:00-07:00&max-results=8&start=72&by-date=false
Chinese Researchers Disrupt Malware Attack That Infected Thousands of PCs,https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/chinese-botnet-malware.html,"May 27, 2020",Ravie Lakshmanan,"Chinese security firm Qihoo 360 Netlab said it partnered with tech giant Baidu to disrupt a malware botnet  infecting over hundreds of thousands of systems.   The botnet was traced back to a group it calls ShuangQiang (also called Double Gun ), which has been behind several attacks since 2017 aimed at compromising Windows computers with MBR and VBR bootkits , and installing malicious drivers for financial gain and hijack web traffic to e-commerce sites.   In addition to using images uploaded to Baidu Tieba  to distribute configuration files and malware — a technique called steganography — the group has begun using Alibaba Cloud storage to host configuration files and Baidu's analytics platform Tongji to manage the activity of its infected hosts, the researchers said.   The initial compromise relies on luring unsuspecting users to install game launching software from sketchy game portals that contain malicious code under the guise of a patch.

A security vulnerability affecting Android  that malicious apps can exploit to masquerade as any other app installed on a targeted device to display fake interfaces to the users, tricking them into giving away sensitive information.   Late last year, at the time of its public disclosure, researchers also confirmed that some attackers were already exploiting the flaw in the wild to steal users' banking and other login credentials, as well as to spy on their activities.   The same team of Norwegian cybersecurity researchers today unveiled  details of a new critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-0096) affecting the Android operating system that could allow attackers to carry out a much more sophisticated version of Strandhogg attack.   Dubbed ' Strandhogg 2.0 ,' the new vulnerability affects all Android devices, except those running the latest version, Android Q / 10, of the mobile operating system—which, unfortunately, is running on only 15-20% of the total",https://thehackernews.com/search?updated-max=2020-05-26T07:40:00-07:00&max-results=8&start=72&by-date=false
